We will design a simple schema with 
three main entities: Users, Posts, and Comments.

Users:

id (primary key)
username
email
password (hashed)
created_at
updated_at
Posts:

id (primary key)
title
content
user_id (foreign key referencing Users)
created_at
updated_at
Comments:

id (primary key)
content
user_id (foreign key referencing Users)
post_id (foreign key referencing Posts)
created_at
updated_at

Implementation:
For the implementation, we will use Node.js with Express.js for the JavaScript implementation and Python with Flask for the Python implementation. We will also use SQLite as the database for simplicity.

Set-up the project:
mkdir blogging_platform_js
cd blogging_platform_js
npm init -y

Install dependencies:
npm install express sequelize pg pg-hstore

Install required dependencies
pip install Flask Flask-SQAlchemy
